              NAD+, or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, is a coenzyme that can be found in all cells in the body. NAD+ is involved in hundreds of metabolic processes in the body and helps supply energy and regulate cellular functions. Unfortunately, the levels of NAD+ normally diminish with age and leave the body exposed to the negative effects of aging like slowed down metabolism, lack of energy, and less elastic skin.

                      Yes! When our cells break down carbohydrates and fats to use them for energy, that energy is stored by creating ATP and NADH. To produce energy, your body's electrons go through the mitochondrial electron chain. NADH is the most significant carrier of these electrons, and once it gives up the electrons, NADH becomes NAD+. You will tend to feel more vital and healthy when your body has the proper ingredients to use these electrons. Without that, you are likely to feel sicker and weaker.

                      Both men and women who suffer from reduced energy levels, feel sluggish and fatigued, or experience mental fog can benefit from NAD+ use. Supplying your system with additional NAD+ can help relieve these unwanted symptoms and provide additional benefits. Some early research also suggests that NAD+ may help protect against the development of neurodegenerative conditions and can help in addiction recovery.
