            <p>
              Testosterone is responsible for many sexual traits in men and plays an important part in a wide range of biological processes. As we age, our body naturally produces less and less testosterone, causing some men to experience a number of unpleasant mental and physical symptoms. In addition to the natural decline in testosterone levels, some men suffer from a condition called hypogonadism which causes an unnaturally low level of testosterone due to a dysfunction in the testicles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) helps to counteract this shift in hormone levels. Testosterone therapy can't reverse the aging process, but it can make aging a more gradual process and limit the physical effects.

Testosterone replacement therapy at LaSara Medical Group is generally safe for most individuals. However, it is always best to consult with your physician before commencing treatment.

                  The first step is to schedule your new patient health assessment. During the appointment, our Medical Team will provide an in-depth assessment of your symptoms and determine if what you are experiencing is in fact low testosterone. After the assessment, we will draw and test your blood to confirm if your testosterone levels are low and check other health markers to ensure you can safely receive testosterone replacement therapy. 
                </p>
                <p class="animate__animated" data-animate="slideInUp">
                  If you are a candidate for TRT, our Medical Director will write you a prescription and train you on how to administer the treatment at home safely. Your treatment will then be self-administered in the comfort of your home. After 3-6 months of treatment, LaSara Medical Group will retest all biological markers and provide a follow-up assessment with our Medical Director to ensure you are experiencing the benefits of TRT.

                      Testosterone replacement therapy is a generally safe treatment with minimal risks. However, there are some conditions that could be made worse by testosterone replacement therapy, so it is important to consult your physician before starting treatment.
